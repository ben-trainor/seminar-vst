# **ED76: The Educational Compressor VST**
### Student Scholarship: Ben Trainor
### Faculty Advisor: G. Jan Wilms

## **Abstract**
*One of the most powerful mixing tools available to an audio engineer is the compressor. Across the many analog and digital variations, the concept remains the same: make loud sounds quieter and quiet sounds louder. Each accomplishes these simple goals in various ways with different controls, circuits, and code, and each colors the sound of a track in unique ways. One of the most iconic compressors is the Universal Audio 1176 Compressor/Limiter which developers have cloned many times over. However, the goal of this project is not primarily to create a free UA 1176 knockoff. Rather, it is to create an educational compressor VST to aid Unionâ€™s commercial music students in early audio production courses. The goal is to reconstruct the original layout to track the stages of an audio signal through a compressor, as well as implement concise right-clickable tooltips and a rich menu to provide users with easily accessible instruction outside of class time.*
